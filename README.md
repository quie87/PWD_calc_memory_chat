### A School project

### Functional requirements PWD

* The application should be a single page application.
* The user shall be able to open multiple windows within the application.
* The user shall be able to drag and move the windows in the document.
* The user shall be able to open and close new windows of the desired application by clicking or double clicking an icon at the desktop.
* The icon used to open the window should be represented in the upper bar of the window.
* Windows should get focus when clicked/dragged.
* The window with focus shall be on top of all other windows.

The following three applications should at least be included in the desktop application:

* A memory-game.
* A chat connected to a central chat channel using web sockets.
* One, by you, designed and decided application. (In my case, a basic calculator)

Feel free to clone the repo and try it out. 
Just run "npm install" and then "npm start" from the terminal and it will run on localhost:4000
(The chat wont work as I have removed the server url and key)
